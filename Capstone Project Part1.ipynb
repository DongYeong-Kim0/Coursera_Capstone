    "In 2019, **25% of Korean are self-employed involuntarily** because of cut-back and employment difficulties. You can find that the rate is very high, compared to other countries such as Japan(10%), US(6%), and OECD average(15%). So, I want to help the self-employed by find out how we select the place to open a store, especially a restaurant. In particular, I want to pay attention to **the number of restaurants per floating population** carefully."
